This project showcases a wireless communication setup employing two Xiao BLE ESP32-C3 boards. The transmitting board is integrated with an MPU6050 accelerometer, whereas the receiving board incorporates a 0.96" OLED display. The system is engineered to identify movements using the MPU6050, exhibit corresponding signals on the OLED display, and control the activation and deactivation of lights.
